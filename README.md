# RacketGame

![Gameplay Demo](gif/gif1.gif)

## Description
I've started working on a new game. :D It's a recreation of a simple project I made in C++ around 5 years ago. In the original version, the idea was to control a racket and avoid asteroids, with each asteroid giving 10 points. In this new version, I'm turning it into a shooter-style game, where the enemies are alien cats. The main goal is to learn by practicing.

### Controls
- **Movement:** W/A/S/D or Arrow Keys  
- **Shoot:** Spacebar

## Used Technologies
- Unity + C#
- Visual Studio

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SabeCiupi/RacketGame.git
2. Open the project in Unity
3. Run the main scene from the `Scenes` folder

## Development Log

| Day   | Update Description |
|-------|--------------------|
| Day 1 | Implemented basic player mechanics, including top-down movement and shooting a horizontal projectile. Learned how to use Unity's Input System and Rigidbody2D for smooth directional control and how to instantiate objects using simple scripting. This serves as the core control scheme for the future game interactions. |
